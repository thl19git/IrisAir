# IrisAir

IrisAir is the perfect work/study buddy. Whilst you are working, it monitors the ambient environment, and uses machine learning to notify you when the conditions are sub-optimal.

This work was completed for partial fulfillment of the Embedded Systems module at Imperial College London.

I was personally responsible for creating the web server and user interface (everything in the UI directory).
The web server was created using Node.js and Express.js, whilst the interface was created using vanilla JS and Handlebars. Sqlite was used for the database.
