# IrisAir

IrisAir is the perfect work/study buddy. Whilst you are working, it monitors the ambient environment, and uses machine learning to notify you when the conditions are sub-optimal.

This work was completed for partial fulfillment of the Embedded Systems module at Imperial College London.
I was personally responsible for creating the web server and user interface (everything in the UI directory).
